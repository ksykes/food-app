                <p>Eating no meat or animal products at all is the most obvious and easy way to avoid animal cruelty, as well as environmental and human health issues – especially since none of the current labelling programs include specific standards or monitoring for transport or slaughter.</p>
                <p>If you’re not ready to cut meat out of your diet entirely, buying your meat directly from a farm whose practices you trust, shopping at farmers markets or visiting the farm yourself can help make your meat consumption ethical while also building your community’s food security and local economy.</p>
                <p>“The key problem is not the erosion of animal-care values by producers, as much as the values of consumers, expressed through their purchasing habits.” — David Fraser, world-renowned expert in animal-welfare science</p>
